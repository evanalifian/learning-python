# Learning Python | Data Structure and Algorithm

Here is my reporitory for learning programming language using python. I will learn data structure and algorithm. Also, i want to train my english skill by making documentation using markdown.

## Python

Python is high level programming language that easy to learn for beginner. It's used for web development, data scientist, data analyst, machine learning, etc.

# Data Structures & Algorithms

## Data Structure

[Data structure](./data_structure/README.md) is a method where you store, manage a data correctly. There are some data structures i will learn such as stacks, queues, hash table, linked list, array, etc.

I will explain each data structure throughout coding implementation.

## Algorithm

Algorithm is a collection of steps to solve a problem. There is no right or wrong way to make algorithm because everyone has their own way to solve a problem.
