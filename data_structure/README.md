# Type Data Structure

There are two type of data structure, and they are:

1. Linear data structure, and
2. Non-linear data structure

## Linear Data Structure

All elements in linear data structure are strored sequentially. It makes easier to implement. Popular linear data structures are:

1. Array
2. Linked List
3. Stack
4. Queue

## Non-Linear Data Structure

In non-linear data structure, element is not stored sequentially, but it's arranged in a hierarchical manner where one element will be connected to one or more elements. Popular non-linear data structures are:

1. Graph
2. Tree
